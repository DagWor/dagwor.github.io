                <p>Littering a dark and dreary road lay the past relics of
                    browser-specific tags, incompatible DOMs, broken CSS
                    support, and abandoned browsers.

                    We must clear the mind of the past. Web enlightenment
                    has been achieved thanks to the tireless efforts of folk
                    like the W3C, WASP, and the major browser creators.

                    The CSS Zen Garden invites you to relax and meditate on
                    the important lessons of the masters. Begin to see with
                    clarity. Learn to use the time-honored techniques in new
                    and invigorating fashion. Become one with the web.</p>

                <h4 class="subtitle">SO WHAT IS THIS ABOUT?</h4>
                <p>There is a continuing need to show the power of CSS. The
                    Zen Garden aims to excite, inspire, and encourage
                    participation. To begin, view some of the existing
                    designs in the list. Clicking on any one will load the
                    style sheet into this very page. The HTML remains the
                    same, the only thing that has changed is the external
                    CSS file. Yes, really.

                    CSS allows complete and total control over the style of
                    a hypertext document. The only way this can be
                    illustrated in a way that gets people excited is by
                    demonstrating what it can truly be, once the reins are
                    placed in the hands of those able to create beauty from
                    structure. Designers and coders alike have contributed
                    to the beauty of the web; we can always push it further.

                    Strong visual design has always been our focus. You are
                    modifying this page, so strong CSS skills are necessary
                    too, but the example files are commented well enough
                    that even CSS novices can use them as starting points.
                    Please see the CSS Resource Guide for advanced tutorials
                    and tips on working with CSS.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You may modify the style sheet in any way you wish, but
                    not the HTML. This may seem daunting at first if you’ve
                    never worked this way before, but follow the listed
                    links to learn more, and use the sample files as a
                    guide.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Download the sample HTML and CSS to work on a copy
                    locally. Once you have completed your masterpiece (and
                    please, don’t submit half-finished work) upload your CSS
                    file to a web server under your control. Send us a link
                    to an archive of that file and all associated assets,
                    and if we choose to use it we will download it and place
                    it on our server.

                <h4 class="subtitle">REQUIREMENTS</h4>
                <p>
                    Where possible, we would like to see mostly CSS 1 & 2
                    usage. CSS 3 & 4 should be limited to widely-supported
                    elements only, or strong fallbacks should be provided.
                    The CSS Zen Garden is about functional, practical CSS
                    and not the latest bleeding-edge tricks viewable by 2%
                    of the browsing public. The only real requirement we
                    have is that your CSS validates..
                </p>
                <p>
                    Luckily, designing this way shows how well various
                    browsers have implemented CSS by now. When sticking to
                    the guidelines you should see fairly consistent results
                    across most modern browsers. Due to the sheer number of
                    user agents on the web these days — especially when you
                    factor in mobile — pixel-perfect layouts may not be
                    possible across every platform. That’s okay, but do test
                    in as many as you can. Your design should work in at
                    least IE9+ and the latest Chrome, Firefox, iOS and
                    Android browsers (run by over 90% of the population).

                    We ask that you submit original artwork. Please respect
                    copyright laws. Please keep objectionable material to a
                    minimum, and try to incorporate unique and interesting
                    visual themes to your work. We’re well past the point of
                    needing another garden-related design.

                    This is a learning exercise as well as a demonstration.

                    release your CSS under a Creative Commons license
                    identical to the one on this site so that others may
